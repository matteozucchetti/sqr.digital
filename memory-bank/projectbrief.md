# Square Project Brief

## Overview
Square is a digital platform that allows users to create and manage their own digital "square" - a profile or business page containing information about a location or business. The platform focuses on providing a way for users to share information about places, including details like address, opening hours, social media links, nearby restaurants, and supermarkets.

## Core Requirements

1. User authentication system
2. Profile creation and management for businesses/locations
3. Logo upload and management capabilities
4. Business information management (bio, address, check-in/out times)
5. Social media links management
6. Related places listings (restaurants, supermarkets)
7. Admin interface for managing all aspects of a "square"
8. Sharing functionality for public viewing

## Goals

- Provide a simple yet comprehensive platform for businesses to create their digital presence
- Enable easy management of business information
- Allow for public sharing of business profiles
- Support integration with location services via direct link to Google Maps

## Technical Approach

- Built with a modern Next.js/React stack
- Backend using Convex for data storage, API, and authentication
- Styled with TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui components
- Multiple integrations for comprehensive functionality (Resend, Autumn, etc.)
- Monorepo structure with Turborepo

This project is using the V1 starter template from Convex as its foundation, providing a solid and scalable architecture from the start.
