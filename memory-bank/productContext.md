# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Small businesses and locations often struggle with maintaining an online presence across multiple platforms. They need a centralized way to share essential information like address, opening hours, social links, and nearby points of interest with customers. This project aims to digitalize all the tourism/facility information through a public page with a scannable QR code. Each user will create as many accommodations as they like, and fill all the info to be visible when public customers scan the QR code. Each accommodation is a "square".

## User Needs
- **Business Owners**: Need a simple way to create and manage their digital presence without complex website building
- **Customers**: Want easy access to business information including location, hours, and relevant nearby places by scanning a QR code (unique for each accommodation url).

## Solution
Square provides a simple, focused platform for creating a digital business card or location profile that can be easily shared. It consolidates essential information in one place with:
- Visual identity (logo)
- Contact information
- Bio/description
- Location information with links to Google Maps
- Operating hours
- Social media presence
- Relevant nearby places (restaurants, supermarkets)
- Additional features planned for future iterations

## User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity**: Make profile creation and management straightforward
- **Shareability**: Create easily shareable profiles/pages
- **Completeness**: Include all essential business information in one place
- **Administrative Control**: Provide a clean admin interface for profile management

## Market Position
Square positions itself as a simpler alternative to full websites or complex business listings. It focuses on essential information sharing rather than complex e-commerce or reservation capabilities.

## Key Differentiators
- Focused specifically on location-based businesses that act as hosts (hotels, b&bs, holiday houses)
- Simplified information management
- Related places listings (creating a small ecosystem of nearby businesses)
- Scalable approach - users can create multiple accommodations based on their pricing plan
